The memory implementation (folder memory_implementation) uses txt file as terminal input.
Hence the text file should be in the same folder as the make and other file.

Make file is there for execution
commands
(type exact same thing in terminal)
make
make exe


The file implementation (folder file_implementation) uses csv file which is being read in the code itself.
Hence the csv file should be in the same folder as other program file.

It is a menu driven code.
1 for array and 2 for file
Then we can enter a value as a positive number without a "-" sign for searching.
For deletion we have to start with a "-" sign and enter the value. It will delete then.(cannot switch between file and array)

for execution type
gcc -w B-trees.c
./a.out
